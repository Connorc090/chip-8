A simple Chip-8 emulator written in Rust. Not all features are complete, but they will be added periodically. Current instructions only allow ibm.ch8 to run.

TODO list:
- Finish instruction set
- Configure sound timer and add a 'beep' sound to assets
- Create basic debugging capabilities
- Add Super Chip capabilities
- Create a launch menu to select rom, sound, and fontset(?) as well as toggle between Super Chip and default Chip-8
- Create a visual debugger
