A simple Chip-8 emulator written in Rust. Not all features are complete, but they will be added periodically. Current progress allows all games to run, although some may be buggy.

TODO list:
- --Finish instruction set--
- Configure sound timer and add a 'beep' sound to assets
- --Handle errors--
- Create basic debugging capabilities
- Add Super Chip capabilities
- Create a launch menu to select rom, sound, and fontset(?) as well as toggle between Super Chip and default Chip-8
- Create a visual debugger
